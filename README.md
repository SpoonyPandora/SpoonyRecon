A random collection of scripts for reconnassiance and operations in and against Windows environments/Active Directory. I wanted to develop scripts that work "living off the land" without use in PowerShell for any RSAT modules and the like - only native Windows capabilities.

Be warned that most of this stuff is incomplete or inaccurate. Don't use this stuff - there is better stuff out there (that actually works) - this is just me working to become less of a script kiddie...
